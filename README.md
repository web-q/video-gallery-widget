#Video Gallery Widget

The Video Gallery Widget is an [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) app written for [HCA](http://hcahealthcare.com)'s Florida Division.

SASS and JS are compiled and minified on save using Gulp. A live version can be published to Github Pages via Gulp `npm run gh-pages`. All of the essential Gulp tasks are pointed to in npm package scripts to refrain from forcing anyone to do a global install of Gulp.

##Requirements
* Node/npm
