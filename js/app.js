The first stage of labor includes early labor and active labor. Early labor can last a few hours; however, the length is very unpredictable and it&rsquo;s hard to know when it will begin or end. The first stage is when the cervix, or bottom part of your womb, changes. The fancy terms you may here your doctor use to describe these cervical changes are dilation (when the cervix opens up) and effacement (when the cervix thins). As your cervix changes, you may also begin to feel contractions at regular intervals. During active labor, your contractions are stronger and occur at regular intervals. You may also feel pressure in your lower abdomen and back.</p>"},{week:33,day:"thursday",task:"Talk to your anesthesiologist about the safety of getting an epidural if you have a lower back tattoo.",why:"<p>In general, women with lower back tattoos who get epidurals during labor rarely have problems. Your anesthesiologist (the doctor who performs the epidural) will want to avoid pushing tattoo ink inside the epidural needle or further into your own tissues. Make sure he or she places the epidural needle in a part of your skin that is free of tattoo ink, or at least makes a little cut in your skin before putting in the needle. This is the safest method, although you may end up with a permanent mark in the tattoo.</p>"},{week:33,day:"friday",task:"Understand that you may continue to cramp as your uterus may contracts after the baby is born. Taking the drug oxytocin may help.",why:"<p>During your pregnancy, your uterus weighs approximately 11 times its pre-pregnancy weight. After your deliver, the uterus begins to contract almost the original size very quickly. Breastfeeding during the immediate postpartum period helps the uterus to begin to decrease in size. Often, the drug oxytocin may be continued in the immediate postpartum period to help decrease the size of the uterus and prevent excessive bleeding.</p>"},{week:33,day:"saturday",task:"Start researching breast pumps.",why:"<p>If you&rsquo;re planning to breastfeed, it&rsquo;s important to be able to pump milk for when you&rsquo;ll be away from the baby for work, a night out, or any other reason. There are lots of breast pumps available. Some are best for working mothers who will pump often, others are best for occasional use.

As the baby grows later in your pregnancy, organs in your body shift and the growing uterus puts pressure on the diaphragm making it hard for your lungs to fully expand. This can make your breathing shallow and give you the sense of shortness of breath. Some helpful hints to breathe easier include sitting or standing up straight, sleeping propped up, slowing down, and lifting your arms over your head. You will need to call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms:</p>\n <ul>\n <li>Sudden or severe breathlessness</li>\n <li>Racing pulse</li>\n <li>Fever or chills</li>\n <li>Vomiting</li>\n <li>Chest pain</li>\n <li>Constant cough</li>\n <li>Dizziness</li>\n </ul>"},{week:35,day:"thursday",task:"Know how to recognize the signs of labor.",why:"<p>Whether this is your first or your fifth baby, each labor experience is different. Nevertheless, there are certain symptoms common to all labors, so it&rsquo;s important to be able to recognize them. Contact your doctor if you experience any of the following:</p>\n <ul>\n <li>Brownish or reddish spotting&mdash;A thick mass of mucous called the mucous plug helps to hold your cervix closed during your pregnancy. Towards the end of your pregnancy, the mucous plug begins to dissolve. Brownish or reddish spotting can indicate that you&rsquo;re losing your mucous plug and getting closer to labor&mdash;anywhere from days, weeks, or hours away.</li>\n <li>Leaking fluid&mdash;Your baby lives in a protective sac of fluid. That sac can break and leak fluid. You will feel the fluid as a urine-like stream, but one that you can&rsquo;t control with your vaginal muscles. Usually that means you will need to deliver the baby within about 24 hours to prevent infections.</li>\n <li>Contractions&mdash;If you feel your uterus and belly squeezing and then releasing, you&rsquo;re having a contraction. When contractions come at a regular, steady pace and start feeling strong and painful, you may be in labor.

Visualizing yourself in a relaxing, peaceful place allows the stress of the immediate situation to fade. But you won&rsquo;t be able to come up with peaceful images during labor.

True labor contractions occur at regular intervals, progressively get closer, continue despite movement or position change, increase in strength, and generally start in the lower back and move to the front of the abdomen. Ask your physician for guidelines for when you should go to the hospital.
